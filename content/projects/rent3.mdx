Our project addresses a common challenge that many of us have encountered: house hunting.

The process of renting a home can be cumbersome due to several factors:

- High Agent Fees: Agents often take up to 20% of the rental payment as their commission, leaving the landlord with just 80%.

- Inefficient Property Viewings: Agents frequently show prospective tenants properties that do not match their preferences, leading to wasted time for all parties involved.

- Limited Payment Options: Despite being in 2024, where some homeowners are open to accepting cryptocurrency payments, most platforms have not adapted to this preference.

To solve these issues, we are developing Rent3, a Web3-based solution designed to streamline the house-hunting process, particularly in urban areas around the world, with a focus on developed countries.

How Rent3 Works:
* Property Listing: Homeowners create profiles and list their properties.
* User Profiles: Potential tenants create profiles on the platform.
* Apartment Selection: Users browse available listings and select properties that meet their criteria.
* Inspection Scheduling: Tenants schedule in-person inspections of the selected properties.
* Seamless Payment: Once a decision is made, tenants can securely transfer the rental payment to the ownerâ€™s address through our platform, finalizing the transaction.
