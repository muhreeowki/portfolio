LPNFT is a DEX solution that revolutionizes liquidity provision in DeFi by combining cutting-edge blockchain technology with user-friendly design. We offer seamless integration through an embeddable frontend that works with any DEX, allowing easy withdrawal, deposit, and trading pair management. Utilizing modified ERC404 contracts, we mint both ERC20 LP tokens and ERC721 NFTs, representing unique ownership in liquidity pools. Our system dynamically generates and verifies unique metadata for each NFT, enhancing the visual and collectible aspects of liquidity provision. We've overcome compatibility challenges and fine-tuned our smart contracts for maximum efficiency and minimal size. Experience the future of DeFi with our innovative solution that bridges the gap between traditional liquidity pools and the exciting world of NFTs.
