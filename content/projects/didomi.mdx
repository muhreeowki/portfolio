Didomi is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that enables users to create and contribute to fundraising campaigns. The platform is built on the Solana blockchain and uses the Anchor framework for smart contract development. Users can create campaigns, contribute to them, and track the progress of campaigns in real-time. Donors can also view the details of campaigns and the amount of funds raised and contribute using cryptocurrencies.
